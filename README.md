The Base64 conversion is designed to represent a binary data stream in a six-bit alphabet (64 characters).  Base64 uses a byte representation for characters, but the alphabet contains only so-called text characters: letters of the Latin alphabet, numbers, and some punctuation marks: 2ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+\ and two special characters:
'=' - a trailing placeholder at the end of the encoded message
'-' - the beginning of the comment
